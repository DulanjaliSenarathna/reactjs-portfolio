## 🔍 SEO & Performance

This project includes several optimizations for SEO and performance:

✅ Semantic HTML tags for accessibility and crawlability

✅ Fast load times with lazy loading for components/images

✅ Clean URL routing via React Router (if used)

✅ Custom metadata (<title>, <meta name="description">) for better search presence

✅ Responsive design to improve Core Web Vitals

✅ 3D models efficiently loaded using suspense and fallbacks

📌 Tip: For even better SEO, consider migrating to Next.js or Gatsby for server-side rendering or static generation.
